# City Capture

## What is it?

City Capture is a real-time virtual capture the flag game where there are multiple flags and they are destinations in your current city. This can be cafes, statues, landmarks, etc. As you run around your city and stand near these destinations, your team will capture the flag and start to count up similar to a KOTH scenario so the other team would have to count your team down before taking the flag.

## What's next?

City Capture was built in a weekend by sleep-deprived college students fueled by goldfish and Monster. Development is currently halted and we will probably never work on it again. Thanks.
